# Emergent Riemann Hypothesis in Temporal Synchronization Theory (TST)

This repository contains Python code for simulating and analyzing the spectral properties of networks in the context of Temporal Synchronization Theory (TST), aiming to explore the emergence of the Riemann Hypothesis.

## Structure

- `src/`: Core simulation and analysis modules
- `tests/`: Unit tests for validation of TST principles
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis
- `utils/`: Helper functions for network generation, visualization, and functional construction

## How to Run

```bash
python src/simulation_runner.py
